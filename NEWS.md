Changes in 3.0.0 (2020-xx-xx)
-----------------------------

This version of libilbc brings the latest updates from upstream WebRTC code.
The API is mostly compatible, but has a few cosmetic changes that nevertheless
require users to adapt.

- Update to latest WebRTC source (r32829, cf8ec1f686).

- A new header is now shipped: ilbd\_export.h. Users should never have to
  interact with it though.

- Various data structures have been renamed. To continue using the original
  naming scheme in your own program, you may use the following typedefs:
  ```c
  typedef IlbcEncoderInstance iLBC_encinst_t;
  typedef IlbcDecoderInstance iLBC_decinst_t;

  // RFC 3951-compatible API:
  typedef IlbcEncoder iLBC_Enc_Inst_t;
  typedef IlbcDecoder iLBC_Dec_Inst_t;
  ```

- Some macros for RFC 3951 compatibility has now been removed. You can restore
  them through:
  ```c
  #define initDecode WebRtcIlbcfix_InitDecode
  #define initEncode WebRtcIlbcfix_InitEncode
  #define iLBC_decode WebRtcIlbcfix_DecodeImpl
  #define iLBC_encode WebRtcIlbcfix_EncodeImpl
  ```

- Many length-like parameters now use the `size_t` type. The following
  functions and structs are affected:

  * WebRtcIlbcfix\_Encode
  * WebRtcIlbcfix\_Decode
  * WebRtcIlbcfix\_Decode20Ms
  * WebRtcIlbcfix\_Decode30Ms
  * WebRtcIlbcfix\_DecodePlc
  * WebRtcIlbcfix\_NetEqPlc
  * IlbcEncoder (né iLBC\_Enc\_Inst\_t) fields
    * blockl
    * nsub
    * no\_of\_bytes, no\_of\_words
    * state\_short\_len
  * IlbcDecoder (né iLBC\_Dec\_Inst\_t) fields
    * blockl
    * nsub
    * no\_of\_bytes, no\_of\_words
    * state\_short\_len
    * last\_lag
    * prevLag
    * enh\_period

Changes in 2.0.2 (2014-12-14)
-----------------------------

- Distribute config.h.cmakein in the release tarball (fixes #14).
- Distribute and install README.md and NEWS.md.
- Miscellanneous distribution improvements.
- Bump shared lib name generated by autotools to libilbc.so.2.0.2 to be
  consistent with the CMake toolchain.

Changes in 2.0.1 (2014-12-11)
-----------------------------

- Update to r7765, cc7755b.
- Fix crash in programs directly calling Init functions, without first
  creating a context through constructors.
- Proper SONAME versioning added, and bumped to libilbc.so.2.

Changes in 2.0.0 (2014-11-17)
-----------------------------

- Under new maintainership by me (Timothy Gu).
- Update to latest upstream source (r7715, 087da13).
  - A threading implementation is now needed. Win32 and POSIX Threads are
    supported.
- Autotools files are cleaned-up.
- CMake now uses BUILD_SHARED_LIBS to determine the type of library to build.
- CMake installation paths on some 64-bit systems using `lib64/` are
  corrected.
- Git metadata for merging from upstream is added for easier merging.
- Travis CI support is added.
